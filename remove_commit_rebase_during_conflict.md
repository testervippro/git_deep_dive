Great! Let's walk through a full simulation using Git commands to **prove before and after** that a commit (`I`) is **removed during rebase**. This will include:

* Creating commits
* Showing logs before and after rebase
* Verifying the `I` commit was removed

---

## ðŸ§ª Full Git Script to Simulate and Prove Commit Is Removed

### âœ… Step 1: Set up a clean Git repo

```bash
# Create and enter a new directory
mkdir rebase-proof && cd rebase-proof
git init
```

---

### âœ… Step 2: Create base commit on main

```bash
echo "line 1" > file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Initial commit on main"
```

---

### âœ… Step 3: Create a feature branch (banned) and add commit I

```bash
git checkout -b banned
echo "line from banned branch" >> file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "I: Add line from banned branch"
```

---

### âœ… Step 4: Go back to main and add conflicting change

```bash
git checkout main
echo "conflicting line from main" >> file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Add conflicting line from main"
```

---

### âœ… Step 5: Show full commit log before rebase (prove `I` exists)

```bash
echo -e "\n--- BEFORE REBASE ---"
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

---

### âœ… Step 6: Rebase `banned` onto `main` and hit conflict

```bash
git checkout banned
git rebase main
```

Now you should see a conflict message. Git pauses and shows conflict markers in `file.txt`.

---

### âœ… Step 7: Resolve conflict by keeping only `main`â€™s version

```bash
cat <<EOF > file.txt
line 1
conflicting line from main
EOF

git add file.txt
git rebase --continue
```

---

### âœ… Step 8: Show full commit log after rebase (prove `I` is gone)

```bash
echo -e "\n--- AFTER REBASE ---"
git log --oneline --graph --all
```

Youâ€™ll see:

* `I: Add line from banned branch` is gone (dropped)
* Only mainâ€™s commits remain

---

### âœ… Step 9: Confirm `I` still exists in `reflog`

```bash
echo -e "\n--- CHECK REFLOG ---"
git reflog | grep "I: Add line from banned branch"
```

---

## âœ… Final Output Summary

| Command                           | Purpose                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `git log --oneline --graph --all` | Prove `I` was there (before), and is gone (after)      |
| `git reflog`                      | Prove Git recorded the dropped commit                  |
| `cat file.txt`                    | Confirms you resolved by keeping only `main`â€™s version |

Let me know if you'd like this wrapped into a shell script to run all at once.
